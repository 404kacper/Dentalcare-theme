Technologies/techniques:

- custom css framework (quicikly customizable colors/element sizes)
- pure css parallax
- fully responsive design


ToDos:

- (aesthetics) do something about image in info section (the vase cannot be skewed it must be straight to match the flow of the website)
- (scaling) bg in image section, pos absolute (?) makes it scale differently from the image itself
- (aesthetics) right side of info text icons is not matching with margin (either increase margin in hero || write more text to reach the margin boundary)
- (typography) change the slogan from "A Reason To Smile"
- (effects/aesthetics) change elements on hero between layers - so that some of them move faster than other and image feels more alive
- (!aesthetics) hero image should be within a wrapper boundaries (but doesn't need to the website flow can shrink down to a wrapper too)
