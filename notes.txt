Technologies/techniques:

- custom sass Typography framework (quickly customizable colors/font sizes)
- custom css framework (quicikly customizable colors/element sizes)
- pure css parallax
- fully responsive design


ToDos:

- (aesthetics) do something about image in info section (the vase cannot be skewed it must be straight to match the flow of the website)
- (scaling) bg in image section, pos absolute (?) makes it scale differently from the image itself
- (aesthetics) right side of info text icons is not matching with margin (either increase margin in hero || write more text to reach the margin boundary)
- (!calculations/parallax) keep in mind that current solution to locking mouth in place with .scrollTop has some fallacy (on parallax_wrapper element with perspective the scroll works weirdly) .scrollHeight is the real height.
   But even at the very bottom of the page it isn't the actual .scrollHeight value.
- (ideas) think about adding smooth scrolling here is the example: https://www.poppr.be/en/work

ToDos v2 (old are done or outdated):
- (bug) chromium mobile menu animation isn't using clip-path properly thus animation is really chunky
